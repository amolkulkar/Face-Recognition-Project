# 😃 Olivetti Faces Recognition in Jupyter

Welcome to the Olivetti Faces Recognition Project!  
This project demonstrates how to recognize human faces using classic machine learning models in an easy, step-by-step Jupyter notebook.  
**Even non-coders can follow along and see the results!**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** [Olivetti Faces](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#olivetti-faces) (400 grayscale images of 40 people)
- **Goal:** Train a computer to recognize whose face is in a photo using machine learning.
- **Approach:** Test and compare three different models:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Data Augmentation:** Flips images to make the model robust and double the training data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Uses PCA to simplify face data, making models faster and more accurate.
- **Model Comparison:** See which model performs best, with clear accuracy scores and explanations.
- **Visualization:** Colorful charts for confusion matrix, accuracy, and misclassified faces.
- **Step-by-Step Explanations:** Each code step is explained in simple language.
- **Modular Code:** Clean, organized, and commented for learning and demonstration.

## 📈 Model Accuracy Comparison Table

After running the notebook, you’ll see results like this (example numbers):

| Model           | Mean Accuracy | Pros                        | Cons                        |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Naive Bayes     | 78%          | Fast, simple, good baseline | Lower accuracy              |
| SVM             | 89%          | High accuracy, robust       | Slower, needs tuning        |
| Random Forest   | 85%          | Good performance, flexible  | Can overfit, less interpretable |

> **Best Model:**  
> In our experiments, **SVM** gave the highest accuracy and best generalization for face recognition on the Olivetti dataset.

## 🤔 How the Project Works 

1. **Get the Data:**  
   The project downloads 400 face images from 40 people.
2. **Data Augmentation:**  
   Each face image is flipped left-right, doubling the data and helping the model learn better.
3. **Feature Reduction (PCA):**  
   The images (each with thousands of pixels) are compressed to their most important features using PCA.
4. **Model Training:**  
   Three different machine learning techniques are trained to recognize faces.
5. **Cross-Validation:**  
   Each model is tested multiple times to ensure the results are fair and reliable.
6. **Visualization:**  
   The results are shown in easy-to-understand graphs and images.
